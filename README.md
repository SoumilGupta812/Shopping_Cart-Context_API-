A **React practice project** focused on solving prop drilling and managing complex state in a shopping cart using Context API and `useReducer`.

---

## 🚀 Covered Concepts
- Prop drilling and why it can be a problem
- Creating, providing, and consuming context to share data across components
- Dispatching actions and updating state with `useReducer`
- Managing and editing state in a structured way

---

## ⚙️ Run Locally 
```bash 
npm install 
npm run dev 
```
---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- React.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Context API for global state
- `useReducer` for state updates
- Git & GitHub

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- When and how to use Context API instead of passing props deeply. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Managing state using `useReducer` and dispatching actions to update it. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Structuring application state for a shopping cart without messy prop chains
- Editing state in a predictable, maintainable way across multiple components
